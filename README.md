## About


The day planner is for a user who wants to create a schedule for a day starting at 9am and ending at 5pm.
The user can type in tasks for the specific time and save what they need to do.
The application has the current day and month displayed at the top of the page, as well as time slots for each hour of a typical work day that you can fill in with tasks. Each slot has a save button that will save any information entered into said slot in order to keep the application current when closing and reopening. The time slots are also color coded to help keep track of your progress throughout the day. Gray is for time slots that have already passed, red is for the current time slot, and green is for upcoming time slots.
